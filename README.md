# Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program
This repository contains my detailed analysis and work on Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Internship provided by InsideSherpa. (This do not contains Quantium model answers)

The problem was to evaluate and analyze the performance of changes at their retail stores and recommend whether it has been successful.
The whole program was divided into three tasks:
- **Task 1:** Data Preparation and Customer Analytics
- **Task 2:** Experimentation and Uplift Testing
- **Task 3:** Analytics and Commercial Application

#### All the files are uploaded in form of PDF also.

## Task 1: Data Preparation and Customer Analytics
In this task, we have to conduct analysis on your client's transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations.
### Approach
1. First, I cleaned dataset and derived new features from the existing features.
2. Then performed EDA and statistical test and came up with initial insights and recommendations.
### Observations and Recommendations
- We should increase the stock of 175gm and 150gm packs at the stores, as they are purchased most across all segments
- We should increase the stock of Pringles and Kettle chips at all stores, because  these are favorite brands among all segments.
- We found that Budget – Older Families are 18% more likely to purchase from Woolworths chips and 22% more likely to purchase 190gm packs than the rest of the population
- Mainstream – Young Singles/Couples are 23% more likely to purchase Twisties chips and 28% more likely to purchase 270 grams packs than the rest of the population
- Mainstream – Retirees are 5% more likely to purchase Twisties chips and 14% more likely to purchase 250 grams packs than the rest of the population
Therefore, we should increase the visibility of these chips at the stores, so that they are more likely to be purchased and resulting in more sales.

## Task 2: Experimentation and Uplift Testing
In this task, we have to find that the store trail which was performed in stores 77, 86 and 88 during the trail period was successful in significantly increasing the sales or not.
### Approach
1. First, I found control store for each trial store that had similar performance in the pre-tril period. For this we chose monthly sales and number of customers as drivers.
2. Then I compared the trail store's performance in trail and pre-trail period considering thier respective control store.
### Observations and Recommendations
- Overall, store trail was successful in increasing the sales
- We can roll out the trail layout in all stores in order to increase the sales and monitor store performance afterwards
- We need to check with the Category Manager, if some different strategy was implemented in trial store 86, because in this store number of customers increased significantly however sales did not.

## Task 3: Analytics and Commercial Application
In this task we need summaries all the important insights and recommendations and present it in a form of a powerpoint presentation.

I used Pyramid principle to prepare the final presentation for Category mangager keeping in view that they are not familiar with scientific terms.
